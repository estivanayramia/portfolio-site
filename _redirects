# Cloudflare Pages / Netlify Redirects Configuration
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/

# Redirect www to non-www (configure in Cloudflare dashboard; Pages redirect file only supports relative paths)
#
# To keep the deployment logs clean, we leave this file free of absolute-host
# redirects. Configure the www→apex redirect via Cloudflare Bulk Redirects
# or a single Transform Rule targeting the `www` host.

# Redirect old paths (if migrating from old site)
# /old-path  /new-path  301

# Language detection (optional - serves default English if no match)
# /*  /index.html  200

# Cloudflare Pages automatically serves 404.html when a path is missing,
# so no explicit redirect is required here.

# SPA-style routing for future expansion
# /app/*  /app/index.html  200
